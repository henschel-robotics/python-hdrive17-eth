# hdrive SDK — Python dependencies
#
# Core library: ZERO external dependencies (uses only Python standard library).
# This is intentional — the SDK should work on any machine with Python 3.8+
# without installing anything beyond the SDK itself.
#
# Install the SDK:
#   pip install .
#
# Or install in development mode:
#   pip install -e ".[dev]"

# --- Development / testing dependencies (optional) ---
# Install with: pip install -e ".[dev]"
#
# pytest>=7.0
# pytest-cov>=4.0
# ruff>=0.1.0
